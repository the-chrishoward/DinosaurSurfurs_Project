/**============================================================================
 * The main HAL struct. This struct encapsulates all of the other input structs
 * in this application as individual members. This includes all LEDs, all
 * Buttons, one HWTimer from which all software timers should reference, the
 * Joystick, and any other peripherals with which you wish to interface.
 * ============================================================================
 * USAGE WARNINGS
 * ============================================================================
 * YOU SHOULD HAVE EXACTLY ONE HAL STRUCT IN YOUR ENTIRE PROJECT. We recommend
 * you put this struct inside of a main [Application] object or in the main
 * function so that every single function in your application has access to the
 * main inputs and outputs which interface with the hardware on the MSP432.
