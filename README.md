Embedded Systems Project - Last Modified April 5th, 2024
This project models the dinosaur game on Google Chrome with a twist. In this rendition, there are three "lanes" instead of one, which makes it similar to subway surfers. This project highlights my knowledge of hardware programming on the MSP432 TI board, coding in C, and hardware abstraction programming. Overall, you can find the final report of my project here:
